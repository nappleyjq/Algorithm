This repository can be regarded as a notebook to record good idea and experience of learning algorithm. Some problems come from ACM competition and are very difficult. Most problems were finally solved with reference to some blog and I hereby express my great thanks to the authors of that. I am not a native english speaker so some of my sentence may seem puzzling, I will try my best to fix it.
